          <h2>HUMANS OF <span style="color:#ec4747;">NORTHWEST</span></h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Alex Smith, a game developer, graphic designer, HTML programmer, music producer, story writer, and photographer. I take on many roles in my everyday life. Many people wonder how I've been able to learn about all of these things, and I answer with, a little bit of free time and a lot of commitment. While school is something that should be important to me, I find myself putting things before it. For example, sometimes, instead of doing homework, I procrastinate by putting my time into learning things about HTML5, or game design.<br />
            <br />
            My interest in game design sparked in 7th grade, and inspired me to start my own game, which I eventually abandoned, thinking it was a bad idea. Now I'm making a choice based text game, where it's so early in development that I don't even know what the story is going to be about, or the basic idea.<br />
            <br />
            My interest in music started in 6th grade, but I only really found out how to use production tools my first year in highschool.
            My sudden interest had allowed me to find a website called Audiotool, where I discovered synthesizers, and FM synthesis. From there I would get into more advanced production tools like Stagelight, Ableton, and Garageband.<br />
            <br />
            As for my interest in HTML, that sparked just this year, when I discovered it. I started teaching myself how to use the markup code known as HTML, the base for all websites you see today. Then after I learned that, I learned how to format it with CSS, and I have been able to create amazing designs and layouts that only I could come up with. Now I'm learning JavaScript, the most complicated of the three web development tools by far. After Learning JavaScript, I might be able to work for amazing companies like Google themselves, or even Mozilla, the two top web developers in the world at the moment.<br />
            <br />
            These accomplishments have been made by dedication that school could have never given me. Learning at my own pace is what's helping me learn these things. For example, on this day, it will be my third day in my break from learning JavaScript, and tomorrow,
            I'll start open up the course on my phone and start learning again, experimenting with it as I learn.<br />
            <br />

          <p>I am a small music artist on Bandcamp, where I make songs for people to download for free, right now I have only 1 song, but soon enough I will have an entire album for my game Zed. I make my tracks on an iPhone SE using GarageBand. Luckily enough, GarageBand is versatile enough to make my tracks sound unique every time.
