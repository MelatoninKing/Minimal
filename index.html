          <h2>ALEX <span style="color:#ec4747;">SMITH</span></h2>
          <p>I'm Alex Smith, a 15-year-old 9th grader at Northwest Highschool in Texas. I am interested in story writing, game design, as well as music production and graphic design. Right now I am creating my first choice based game. It will be programmed completely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also working on this blog on the side, after finishing my Creative Writing class, I will continue this blog, updating anyone interested on the progress on my game, as well as positing links to my github repositories for the web themes that I make.</p>
